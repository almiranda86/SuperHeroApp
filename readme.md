## The Super Hero Project

Here, the main idea is to use the https://superheroapi.com/index.html and create the same application, with different technologies, in order to gain experience by doing a small API consume project, and maybe some gamification too.

At this moment, the stacks are divided in 3 groups:
Backend, Frontend and Mobile

For the backend, I'm aiming to develop this with:

 - C#
 - Java
 - Deno
 - Node
 - Go
 - Python
 - Ruby
 - PHP
 - NestJs

For the frontend, I'm aiming to develop this with:

 - Angular
 - React
 - Vue 
 - Next 
 - Blazor 
 - RubyOnRails
 - PHP

For the  mobile, I'm aiming to develop this with:

 - Android
 - ReactNative
 - Flutter
 - Xamarin


In the future, I could maybe do some login validation, just for fun, in order to learn more about OAuth, access to the endpoint by granted login and do this by a simple database with user login/password.
